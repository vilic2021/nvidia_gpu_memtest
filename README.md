‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status
Discontinued ‚Äî This project is no longer active.
It was closed due to limited time and technical challenges beyond current expertise.
Feel free to fork or explore the code for reference.



Thank you for your interest in the project!

Unfortunately, this project is currently on hold due to:

Limited time for proper development
Technical complexities with low-level GPU access
Lack of necessary documentation for NVIDIA hardware
I may revisit it in the future when I have more experience with:

DOS programming
PCI/MMIO hardware access
NVIDIA's internal architecture
Feel free to fork the repository if you want to experiment with the code!
